rem2pdf is a Perl program that takes the output of "remind -p" and
produces a PDF calendar.  See "man rem2pdf" for details.

rem2pdf has the following Perl modules as prerequisites:

        Pango - https://metacpan.org/pod/Pango
        Cairo - https://metacpan.org/pod/Cairo

On Debian or Debian-derived systems, these can be installed with:

        apt install libpango-perl libcairo-perl

On Red Hat or Red Hat-derived systems, you need to install the perl-Pango
and perl-Cairo RPMs, which may require adding other repos to your list of
RPM sources.

rem2pdf is built and installed in the usual Perl program way:

        perl Makefile.PL && make && sudo make install
